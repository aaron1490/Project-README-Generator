## Description
This is a simple, good quality README Generator for all future projects. Created using JavaScript and Nodejs. This is run at the command line, prompting the user to answer a series of questions generating a README file in markdown format.

## Installation
1.) Ensure that you have dependencies such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already installed.<br> 2.) Clone the code [repository](https://github.com/aaron1490/Project-README-Generator) to your local machine.<br> 3.) Navigate to the root of the project folder that you've just cloned.<br> 4.) Run ```npm i``` either on git bash or on the integrated terminal to install all required node modules required.

## Usage
To run the program, type ```node index.js``` into the terminal. You'll be faced with a series of questions to answer.

## Test
As part of testing and making sure the application runs correctly, I have pathed the generated README files to be generated within the testing-folder rather than the root. Once you are happy with the README file, feel free to move it to the root. This is done so that it doesn't overwrite an already existing README file in the root of the project folder.
